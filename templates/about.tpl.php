		<h2 class="base_h1">CAIRS offers numerous advantages over plastic or acrylic corneal implants.</h2>	
		<ol class="base_ol">
			<li>
				<strong>Heightened Therapeutic Impact<br></strong>
				Acrylic ring segments are typically implanted at a depth of 80-85% to minimize the risk of extrusion. However, this depth limits their influence on shaping the cornea’s front surface. In contrast, CAIRS can be inserted at a shallower depth of 50%, allowing for a more pronounced impact on the corneal surface and its shape.
				<br>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Biocompatibility<br></strong>
				One of the primary benefits of utilizing corneal tissue is its natural integration within the body. Unlike artificial materials, which can trigger foreign body reactions and potentially lead to scarring, corneal tissue is well-recognized by the body and is less likely to cause adverse reactions.
				<br>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Enhanced Stability<br></strong>
				Synthetic implants, such as acrylic ones, may experience shifting or migration over time, especially if patients frequently rub their eyes. In some cases, poorly positioned acrylic implants can result in corneal melting and erosion onto the eye’s surface, potentially leading to infections. Conversely, Corneal Allograft Integrated Ring Segments (CAIRS) demonstrate improved stability due to their seamless integration with the existing tissue.
				<br>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Expanded Candidate Pool<br></strong>
				CAIRS offers a wider range of potential candidates for treatment, including those with more advanced conditions and thinner corneas. Patients who would not have qualified for Intrastromal Corneal Ring Segments (ICRS) due to concerns of extrusion can now benefit from CAIRS. In the past, these individuals might have only had the option of a more invasive full corneal graft. Patients with corneal that are too thin for plastic corneal segments may still be good candidates for CAIRS.
				<br>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Enhanced Personalisation<br></strong>
				Surgeons have complete control over the dimensions of CAIRS implants, as they are meticulously crafted using laser technology. This level of customization allows the implants to be tailored precisely to each patient’s unique needs and requirements.
